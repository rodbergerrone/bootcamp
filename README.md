This folder consist of excersices done during ALX Python Bootcamps.
This folder is structured around main Python topics like basics, collections, iteration, libs, modules, functions, oop, web, etc.
If you wanna check something more substantial I recomend to visit "_portfolio" in which I colleted some small software/scrpits written by me during the bootcamp.
